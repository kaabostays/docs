## System Architecture

The Kaabo backend follows a RESTful API architecture built with Node.js and Express.js, using MongoDB as the primary database. The architecture is organized into the following key components:

### Core Components

- **Controllers**: Handle business logic and request processing
- **Models**: Define database schemas and data structure
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and request routing
- **Middleware**: Handle authentication, validation, and request processing
- **Utils**: Contain utility functions and helper methods
- **Config**: Manage application configuration and environment variables
