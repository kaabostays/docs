## System Architecture

The Kaabo platform follows a modern web application architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page applications (SPAs) for both the user interface and admin panel
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js RESTful API
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary for image storage
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Google Calendar, payment gateways, email services

## Component Documentation

Detailed documentation for each component of the Kaabo platform is available in the following files:

- [Backend Documentation](./backend_documentation.md): Details about the API, database models, and server-side functionality.
- [Control Center Documentation](./control_center_documentation.md): Information about the administrative panel and its features.
- [User Frontend Documentation](./user_frontend_documentation.md): Documentation for the client-facing application.

## Key Features

### For Users

- Browse and book stays and experiences
- User authentication and profile management
- Wishlist functionality
- Booking management
- Feedback and ratings
- Messaging system
- Investment opportunities

### For Administrators

- Comprehensive dashboard with analytics
- User management
- Listing and experience management

- Category management

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling
- **JWT**: Authentication
- **Cloudinary**: Image storage
- **Google Calendar API**: Calendar integration

### Frontend (User & Admin)

- **React**: UI library
- **Vite**: Build tool
- **React Router**: Routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **React Toastify**: Notifications

## Development and Deployment

Both frontend applications are built using Vite and can be deployed to any static hosting service. The backend API requires a Node.js hosting environment with access to a MongoDB database.

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication
- Protected API routes
- Secure password handling
- HTTPS for all communications
- Environment variables for sensitive information

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development include:

- Mobile applications
- Enhanced analytics
- Additional payment options
- Expanded investment features
- Localization for multiple languages
- Advanced search and filtering
