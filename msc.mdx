# Web Hosting

Kaabo uses GoDaddy for web domain registration services. GoDaddy provides domain registration and other web hosting services for the Kaabo platform.

## DNS Management

Cloudflare is used for DNS hosting and management. Cloudflare provides enhanced security, performance optimization, and reliable DNS services for the Kaabo platform.

## Server Infrastructure

The Kaabo application (both frontend and backend) is hosted on Vultr's virtual machines. Vultr provides cloud computing services with high-performance SSD VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting, which offers:

- Scalable resources
- Global data center locations
- High-performance infrastructure
- Cost-effective pricing

## Application Architecture

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js/Express.js application that serves both the API endpoints and the static frontend files in production.

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application built with Vite. In production, the built frontend files are served by the backend Express.js server.

## Frontend Entry Point

The entry point for frontend requests is handled in the server.js file. In production mode, the Express server serves the static files from the built frontend application:

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  // user static site
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../../kaabo_user/dist")));

  app.get("*", (req, res) =>
    res.sendFile(
      path.resolve(__dirname, "../", "../", "kaabo_user", "dist", "index.html")
    )
  );
} else {
  app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Please set to production"));
}
```

This configuration:

1. Serves static files (JS, CSS, images, etc.) from the `kaabo_user/dist` directory
2. For any other routes that don't match API endpoints, it serves the `index.html` file from the frontend build, allowing the React router to handle client-side routing

## Monitoring

Kaabo uses foresightapi.xyz to monitor tags on the frontend. This service provides insights into user interactions, performance metrics, and helps track frontend behavior in production.

## Deployment Workflow

The typical deployment workflow involves:

1. Building the frontend application (`npm run build` in the kaabo_user directory)
2. Deploying the backend application to the Vultr VM
3. Ensuring the built frontend files are accessible to the backend server

This setup allows for a simplified deployment process where a single server handles both the API and serves the frontend application.
